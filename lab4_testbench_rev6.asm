# address of file buffer: 0xffff0000 (MMIO)
# address of file record pointers(for location of starting points 
#    of stock name and income): 0x10040000 (heap)

# URGENT: make sure your csv file follows the Windows csv format:
# Windows uses a carriage return (\r) followed by line feed: (\n)
#   versus Linux or Mac: which ends their lines with a line feed.
# So lines should be like this:
#   "Facebook,56\r\nApple,100"
.text
.include "macros_rev2.asm"
# macros currently can only affect the state of: a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a7
